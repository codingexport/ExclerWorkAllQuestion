# 📊 Tableau File Extensions - Explained

This document provides a list of commonly used Tableau file extensions along with a brief explanation for each. It is useful for anyone working with Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server and looking to understand the structure and purpose of each file type.

---

## 📁 Tableau File Extensions

| Extension | File Type                         | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `.twb`    | Tableau Workbook                 | Contains visualization structure, formatting, and settings, but **not the data** itself. It is XML-based and requires access to the data source to display the visualizations. |
| `.twbx`   | Tableau Packaged Workbook        | A packaged version of `.twb` that includes the workbook and **all local data sources, images, and custom fonts**. Ideal for sharing visualizations. |
| `.tds`    | Tableau Data Source              | Contains metadata about a data source such as calculated fields, custom groups, bins, default properties, and joins. It does **not contain actual data**. |
| `.tdsx`   | Tableau Packaged Data Source     | A packaged version of `.tds` that includes the data source file and **local data**. Useful for sharing complete data connections. |
| `.tde`    | Tableau Data Extract (legacy)    | Extracted snapshot of the data optimized for fast performance. Replaced by `.hyper` in newer versions. |
| `.hyper`  | Tableau Hyper Data Extract       | The new and improved extract format introduced in Tableau 10.5. It's more efficient and supports larger datasets and faster query performance. |
| `.tms`    | Tableau Map Source               | Stores map service connection details, such as background maps or WMS connections. |
| `.tbm`    | Tableau Bookmark                 | Used to save individual worksheets (charts, dashboards, etc.) for reuse across workbooks. |
| `.tfl`    | Tableau Flow File                | Contains a Tableau Prep flow file (introduced in Tableau Prep), showing how data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared. |
| `.tflx`   | Tableau Packaged Flow File       | A packaged version of `.tfl`, which includes data files and resources needed for the Prep flow. |

## 💡 Notes

- **Packaged files** (like `.twbx`, `.tdsx`, `.tflx`) are great for sharing with others who may not have access to the original data sources.
- **Extract files** (`.tde`, `.hyper`) are used to improve performance and support offline analysis.
- XML-based files like `.twb` and `.tds` can be opened with a text editor for debugging or version control purposes.

# Tableau Filters, Data Modeling & Calculations – Interview Friendly Summary

This document provides a concise explanation of various important Tableau features, commonly asked in interviews for Data Analyst or BI roles. It includes types of filters, modeling features, and calculation functions.

---

## 🔍 Filters in Tableau

### 1. **Dimension Filter**
- Filters categorical data like Region, Category, etc.
- Applied before aggregation.
- ✅ *Example*: Filter only “East” and “West” regions.

---

### 2. **Measure Filter**
- Filters aggregated measures like SUM(Sales), AVG(Profit), etc.
- Applied after aggregation.
- ✅ *Example*: Filter sales greater than 10,000.

---

### 3. **Data Source Filter**
- Filters applied directly at the data source level.
- Helps with performance and security (e.g., row-level security).
- ✅ *Example*: Filter data for only the year 2023.

---

### 4. **Quick Filter (Show Filter)**
- A user-interface-based filter on the dashboard.
- Allows users to filter data using dropdowns or checkboxes.
- ✅ *Example*: Filter by product category on the dashboard.

---

### 5. **Context Filter**
- Applied first, sets the base for other filters.
- Improves performance and allows dependent filters.
- ✅ *Example*: Context filter on “East” region → apply Top N within East.

---

## 🧱 Data Modeling Features

### 6. **Hierarchy**
- Allows drill-downs in data (e.g., Year → Quarter → Month).
- ✅ *Example*: Sales per Year, drill down to Quarter.

---

### 7. **Group**
- Combine multiple dimension members into one group.
- ✅ *Example*: Combine “Phones” and “Laptops” into “Electronics”.

---

### 8. **Sets**
- Subset of data based on condition or manual selection.
- Types: Fixed Set & Dynamic Set.
- ✅ *Example*: Top 10 customers by Sales (dynamic set).

---

### 9. **Parameter**
- A dynamic input value controlled by the user.
- Can be used in filters, calculations, reference lines, etc.
- ✅ *Example*: Parameter to display Top N customers.

---

## 🧮 Calculations in Tableau

### 🥇 Top 3 Most Important Calculations

#### 1. **Calculated Field**
- Custom field created with a formula.
- ✅ *Example*: `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN "Profit" ELSE "Loss"`

#### 2. **Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions**
- Used to fix or change the level of aggregation.
- ✅ *Example*: `{FIXED [Customer Name] : SUM(Sales)}`

#### 3. **Table Calculations**
- Calculations based on table structure (e.g., % of total, running sum).
- ✅ *Example*: `RUNNING_SUM(SUM(Sales))`, `RANK(SUM(Profit))`

## 📊 Aggregation in Tableau

**Aggregation** is the process of combining multiple values into a single value — usually to summarize or analyze large datasets.

---

### ✅ Common Aggregation Functions

| Function     | Meaning                              | Example                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `SUM()`      | Total of values                      | Total Sales                    |
| `AVG()`      | Average of values                    | Average Profit per Product     |
| `MIN()`      | Minimum value                        | Lowest Order Quantity          |
| `MAX()`      | Maximum value                        | Highest Discount Given         |
| `COUNT()`    | Number of values                     | Total Customers                |
| `COUNTD()`   | Count of distinct values             | Unique Regions                 |

---

### 🎯 Aggregation in Tableau

When you drag a **measure** like `Sales` into the view in Tableau, it is **automatically aggregated**, typically using `SUM()` as the default.

#### Example:
- **Dimension**: `Region`
- **Measure**: `Sales`
- **Aggregation**: `SUM(Sales)` → Total sales for each region

---

### 💡 Interview Tip

> **Q:** What happens when you drag a measure like Profit into the view?  
> **A:** Tableau aggregates it using the default aggregation (usually SUM), so it displays `SUM(Profit)`. You can change it to other aggregations like `AVG(Profit)` or `MAX(Profit)` based on the requirement.

---

### 🔍 Why Aggregation is Important

- Simplifies large datasets for better analysis
- Enables comparisons, rankings, and KPIs
- Essential for calculations, dashboards, and visuals in Tableau
